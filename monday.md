# Growth Mindset #
Growth Mindset is realizing that everyone can learn a new skill, and improve upon something they know with practice and effort.

## **My 3 reminders** ##
1. *Everyone has a hard time first learning something NEW*
2. *I learned __English__ I can learn anything else*
3. *It __will__ click, it just hasn't...yet*
