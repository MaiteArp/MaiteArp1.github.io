### Ch 11 ### 

* Color brings your site to life, helps convey mood, and evokes reactions. 
* Three ways to specify color RGB values, hex codes, and color names 
* Color pickers can help you find the color you want 
* It's important to ensure contrast between text and background 
* CSS3 introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity (RGBA)
* CSS3 allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with and optional opacity value (HSLA) 

### ch 10 ###

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appeared inside a box and uses rules to indicate how it should look 
* Rules are made up of selectors (specify the element) and declarations (specify what it should look like)
* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements 
* Declarations are made up of two parts, properties of the elements to change and the values of those properties
* CSS usually appear in a different document, though they may appear whithin an HTML page
