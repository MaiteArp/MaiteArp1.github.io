# This is ME #

![wolf](/wolf.jpg)

Sooooo... I was born in Lima - Peru, a while ago. I moved to the US in 2004 while in highschool. Horrible experience... 1 out of 10 would not 
do it again :-1: Moved on to college, married, moved to Seattle, had kids, moved out of Seattle (only to the suburbs) and decided to start a new 
carreer. So that's me... in a nutshell, for more details find me.
