# Growth Mindset #
Growth Mindset is realizing that everyone can learn a new skill, and improve upon something they know with practice and effort.

## **My 3 reminders** ##
1. *Everyone has a hard time first learning something NEW*
2. *I learned __English__ I can learn anything else*
3. *It __will__ click, it just hasn't...yet*

# This is ME #

Sooooo... I was born in Lima - Peru, a while ago. I moved to the US in 2004 while in highschool. Horrible experience... 1 out of 10 would not 
do it again :-1:. Moved on to college, married, moved to Seattle, had kids, moved out of Seattle (only to the suburbs) and decided to start a new 
carreer. So that's me... in a nutshell, for more details find me.
